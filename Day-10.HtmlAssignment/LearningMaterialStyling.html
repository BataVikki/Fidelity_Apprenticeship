        <h1>SQL is a standard language for accessing and manipulating databases.</h1><br>

            <h4>What is SQL?</h4><br>
           <p> SQL stands for Structured Query Language
            SQL lets you access and manipulate databases
            SQL became a standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986,
             and of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1987</p><br>
            <h4>What Can SQL do?</h4>
            <p>SQL can execute queries against a database
            SQL can retrieve data from a database
            SQL can insert records in a database
            SQL can update records in a database
            SQL can delete records from a database
            SQL can create new databases
            SQL can create new tables in a database
            SQL can create stored procedures in a database
            SQL can create views in a database
            SQL can set permissions on tables, procedures, and views</p><br>
            <h4>SQL is a Standard 
            BUT....</h4><br>
           <p> Although SQL is an ANSI/ISO standard, there are different versions of the SQL language.
            
            However, to be compliant with the ANSI standard, they all support at least the major commands (such as SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, INSERT, WHERE) in a similar manner.
            
            Note: Most of the SQL database programs also have their own proprietary extensions in addition to the SQL standard!
            
            Using SQL in Your Web Site
            To build a web site that shows data from a database, you will need:
            
            An RDBMS database program (i.e. MS Access, SQL Server, MySQL)
            To use a server-side scripting language, like PHP or ASP
            To use SQL to get the data you want
            To use HTML / CSS to style the page
        </p>
